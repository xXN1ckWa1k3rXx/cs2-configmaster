# CS2-Configmaster
Video settings / Gameplay settings configuration generation for Counter-Strike 2

### Work in progress  

# What is this?

Players can generate a unique settings cfg file, whether it is a video cfg or crosshair or console binds, or some tools

Inspired by [mastercomfig for Team Fortress 2](https://comfig.app/)

# When release?
I can't give a final answer cuz I can't put all my energy into this project. this project will not have a final 1.0 due to the continuous improvement of the website and the coding of javascript.

As the website was redesigned, the old video settings were moved to the old folder, including fixing the problem that the resolution select could not be set normally in the old main page.

New page everything unavailable yet. Old page video settings available

# Known issues
- The video page takes too long to load (Shouldn't happen in local). Maybe it's because too much webp is loaded and needs to be preloaded?
