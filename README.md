# CS2-Configmaster
Video settings / Gameplay settings configuration generation for Counter-Strike 2

### Work in progress  



# What is this?

Players can generate a unique settings cfg file, whether it is a video cfg or crosshair or console binds, or some tools

Inspired by [mastercomfig for Team Fortress 2](https://comfig.app/)

# When release?
Unknown. This project is not my main task, so my idea is to try to improve it slowly in my limited time. The repository paths/html and scripts will looks sh*t, but I will sort them out when configmaster officially releases 1.0.

Video settings is availabled / Multi-Language WIP
