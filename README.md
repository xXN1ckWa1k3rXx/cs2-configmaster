# CS2-Configmaster
Video settings / Gameplay settings configuration generation for Counter-Strike 2

### Work in progress  

# What is this?

Players can generate a unique settings cfg file, whether it is a video cfg or crosshair or console binds, or some tools and helping players get more advantages.

Inspired by [mastercomfig for Team Fortress 2](https://comfig.app/)

# When release?
I can't give a final answer cuz I can't put all my energy into this project. this project will not have a final 1.0 due to the continuous improvement of the website and the coding of javascript.

Website redesigned. Old page has been moved to the ["old" folder](./old/).
All the old main page issues/bug has been fixed. New page's javascript still need to recode

New page's video setting generate is completed but not sure if generate's config is correct
**For more stable cfg generation go to [old page](./old/main.html)**

# Known issues
- ~~The video page takes too long to load~~  (because uses fontawsome cdn)
